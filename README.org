rankSVMcompare

Support vector machines for ranking and comparing. https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8008

- a ranking function r(x) takes an object x and returns a real-valued rank score -- bigger is better. 
- a comparison function c(x1, x2) takes two objects x1 and x2, and returns 
  - 1 if x2 is significantly better,
  - -1 if x1 is significantly better,
  - 0 if there is no significant difference between x1 and x2.
- in our model, an absolute rank difference greater than 1 is considered a significant difference.
- the model is trained on labeled pairs (x1,x2,y) where x1 and x2 are p-dimensional feature vectors, and y is a label (-1, 0, 1).
